This repository contains the code for the paper "Ensemble neural network forecasts with singular value decomposition" by Sebastian Scher and Gabriele Messori.
For Era 5 and for Plasimt42, there are separate scripts for
1) training the neural networks
2) computing the jacobians and the singular vectors
3) doing and evaluating the forecasts
4) make plots
for Lorenz95, 3) and 4) are combined into a single script.

The repository also contains the output from step 3) (in the folders "output" and "data") and all plots.
